## Deployment Environments - Cont'd

In this lab, you will create the Production environment and deploy the ready-made CoolStore application into this environment.

In the current lab, in order for you to become familiar with both the OpenShift Web Console and the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), every step is explained via both the Web Console and CLI which you can choose based on your preferences. Either way leads to the exact same result.
Let’s create the _Prod_ deployment environment and deploy the CoolStore application.
The steps are as follows:
* Create the production project space
* Upload the Coolstore application templates
* Use the CoolStore template to launch the application

#### Create Project via OpenShift Web Console

In OpenShift Web Console, click on the *New Project* button again in order to create a new project, enter the following details and click on *Create* button:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

* Name: `prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}`
* Display Name: `CoolStore Production`

The Prod deployment project for the CoolStore application is created now and is ready for the application to be deployed.

#### Templates
Now, in order to deploy the CoolStore application we will use a Template.
A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift Container Platform.
OpenShift Container Platform provides a number of default Instant Apps and Quickstart templates to make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for different languages.
You can create a list of objects from a template using the CLI or, if a template has been uploaded to your project or the global template library, using the web console.


You can list the available default Instant App and Quickstart templates with:
[source,shell]
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

#### Uploading the CoolStore Template
If you have a JSON or YAML file that defines a template, you can upload the template to projects using the CLI as follows:
[source,shell]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azipory/cicd-openshift-workshop-labs/master/openshift/coolstore-deployment-template.yaml -n openshift
----

The CoolStore template is now available for selection using the web console or the CLI.

Before we deploy the application let's take a look at the template.

You can see the images that are used to deploy this template.
Using the command line let explore the parameters required for this template.

[source,shell]
----
oc get template coolstore -n openshift -o yaml
----

let’s deploy the CoolStore application, using the uploaded template, into the Production environment.
