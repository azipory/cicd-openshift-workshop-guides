## Deployment Environments


In this lab, you will create the Production environment and deploy the ready-made CoolStore application into this environment.

In the current lab, in order for you to become familiar with both the OpenShift Web Console and the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), every step is explained via both the Web Console and CLI which you can choose based on your preferences. Either way leads to the exact same result.
Let’s start with with creating the _Prod_ deployment environment and deploying the CoolStore application.

#### Create Project via OpenShift Web Console

In OpenShift Web Console, click on the *New Project* button again in order to create a new project, enter the following details and click on *Create* button:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

* Name: `dev-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}`
* Display Name: `CoolStore Production`

The Prod deployment project for the CoolStore application is created now and is ready for the application to be deployed.

image::devops-envs-dev-project.png[Dev Project]

By default, the current user who created the project is the _admin_ for this project. The OpenShift cluster admins or the project admins can define granular access control on the project and control how can view, modify or deploying applications in each project. This is particularly essential for example when you want developers to be able to view the _Prod_ environments and get debug information without allowing them to modify the state of those environments. In order to review the access control on the _Dev_ project, click on *Resources -> Membership* on the left sidebar menu. Note that the current user has the _admin_ role.

#### Templates
Now, in order to deploy the CoolStore application we use Templates.
A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift Container Platform.
OpenShift Container Platform provides a number of default Instant Apps and Quickstart templates to make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for different languages.

You can list the available default Instant App and Quickstart templates with:
[source,shell]
$ oc get templates -n openshift

You can create a list of objects from a template using the CLI or, if a template has been uploaded to your project or the global template library, using the web console.

## Uploading the CoolStore Templates
If you have a JSON or YAML file that defines a template, you can upload the template to projects using the CLI as follows:
[source,shell]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azipory/cicd-openshift-workshop-labs/master/openshift/coolstore-deployment-template.yaml -n openshift

The CoolStore template is now available for selection using the web console or the CLI.

let’s deploy the CoolStore application, into the Production environment.


OpenShift introduces a mechanism called {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)] which is a tool for building docker container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the application runtime base image and built source code and is ready to use with the docker run command. The application base runtime might be various language runtimes such as Java, Ruby, NodeJS, Python, etc or middleware runtimes such as Apache Tomcat, JBoss EAP, etc.

S2I can also take application binaries such as JAR, WAR or EAR files as input and build a new docker image for the application combined with the application runtime.

If you already have a process in-place for building docker images, OpenShift allows you to point to the ready docker images and deploy them as is on the platform.

In this lab, you will use the S2I mechanism for building the Cart service from source code. Since Cart service is based on Spring Boot, you only need the Java language runtime for running this service and therefore you will use the certified OpenJDK application runtime which is provided in OpenShift out-of-the-box. Click on *Add to project* button to open the service catalog. The catalog shows the list of available language and application runtimes as well as templates. A template describes how to build, configure and deploy a set of containers in a reproducible manner. OpenShift templates simplify composing complex multi-container applications and makes it easy to recreate and configure complete applications from scratch by deploying a template.

Enter _jdk_ in the text field in order to find the OpenJDK 1.8 language runtime, and then click on *redhat-openjdk18-openshift*.

image::devops-envs-catalog-jdk.png[OpenJDK Base Image]

Now that you have chosen the Java language runtime, you can enter the URL to the Cart service application source code to specify it as an input to the S2I process. Enter the following in the text fields:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

  * Name: `cart`
  * Git URL: `{{GIT_SERVER_INTERNAL_URL}}/{{GIT_USER}}/cart-service.git`

image::devops-envs-cart-newapp.png[Deploy Cart Service]

Click on *Show advanced options for source, routes, builds, and deployments* to review advanced options for setting memory and cpu limits, environment variables, scaling and more when deploying an application. In this lab, similar to most development teams a Maven artifact repository (e.g. Sonatype Nexus and Artifactory) is used for managing Maven artifacts. Add the following environment variable under *Build Configuration* to specify the Maven repository manager URL to be used during the build phase:

* Name: `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`
* Value: `{{NEXUS_URL}}`

Note that the Maven repository manager URL is an internal URL and is not accessible externally. Click on *Create* button and then on *Continue to overview*.

All required resources are created in order to build and deploy the Cart service in the Dev project. OpenShift provides an out-of-the-box load-balancer which is automatically updated to route traffic to Cart service when the container is deployed and ready to receive traffic.

In order to make the Cart service available externally, you have to associate the service with an {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[externally-reachable] host name. You can do that simply by clicking on *Create Route* link on the right-side of the Cart service. You can modify the route URL by specify the route name or use a custom hostname as well as enabling SSL, etc but in this lab you will use the default values. Click on *Create* to create the route.

In the project overview, the Cart service S2I build process is running to build first the application JAR file and then a docker image by layering the JAR file on the OpenJDK base image.

Click on *View Log* link to see the build logs as it runs. You can click on the *Follow* link to follow the logs in the browser.

image::devops-envs-cart-build-logs.png[Build Logs]

When the build finishes and the application docker image is created, the docker image is pushed by default to OpenShift internal registry and then deployed to OpenShift. Builds also support pushing the built image to other image registries outside OpenShift.

image::devops-envs-cart-deployed.png[Create Cart Service]

Notice the warning about lack of health checks on the deployed container. OpenShift uses health checks to detect and handle or heal unhealthy containers which is not set yet on the deployed Cart service. OpenShift runs the following probes to manage the container and application health:

* _Liveness Probe_: a liveness probe checks if the container is still running. If the liveness probe fails, OpenShift restarts the container
* _Readiness Probe_: a readiness probe determines if a container is ready to service requests. If the readiness probe fails, OpenShift removes that container from the list of endpoints in the service load-balancer. A readiness probe can be used to signal the service load-balancer that even though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic.

There are multiple ways to check a container liveness and readiness. You can define an HTTP URL, a command to execute in the container or a TCP socket to connect to. Click on *Add health checks* and configure HTTP liveness and readiness probes for the Cart service.

* Type: `HTTP`
* Path: `/health`
* Port: `8080`
* Initial Delay: `15`

image::devops-envs-cart-healthchecks.png[Create Cart Service]

Wait till the Cart service is re-deployed with the new health check configurations and then verify that the Cart service is functioning by pointing your browser to the Cart service REST endpoint: `http://cart-dev-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}.{{OPENSHIFT_APPS_HOSTNAME}}/health`

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

Alternatively, you can use the `curl` command to verify that the Cart service is functioning:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://cart-dev-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}.{{OPENSHIFT_APPS_HOSTNAME}}/health

{"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":10725883904,"free":9970741248,"threshold":10485760},"refreshScope":{"status":"UP"},"hystrix":{"status":"UP"}}
----

Note that Cart is a REST service and does not provide any web page at the root of the application.

#### Create Project via OpenShift CLI

You can perform the same steps as above using the OpenShift CLI commands. Start with creating the _Dev_ project:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc new-project dev-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}} --display-name="Cart Dev"
----

You can now create the Cart service by specifying the language runtime base image, the source code repository and a name for the service:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.0~{{GIT_SERVER_URL}}/{{GIT_USER}}/cart-service.git \
    --name=cart \
    --build-env=MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://nexus.lab-infra.svc:8081/content/groups/public/

--> Found image bc310f6 (5 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/redhat-openjdk18-openshift" under tag "latest" for "redhat-openjdk18-openshift"
    Java Applications

    Tags: builder, java
    * A source build using source code from {{GIT_SERVER_URL}}/{{GIT_USER}}/cart-service.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "cart:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "cart"

----

The Cart service is accessible by default within OpenShift. You can update the built-in load-balancer in OpenShift to route traffic to the Cart service by exposing the internal Cart service:
[source,shell]
----
$ oc expose svc/cart
route "cart" exposed
----

You can also view the build logs as the build is running:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc logs bc/cart -f
----

And finally, define the `/health` HTTP URL as the liveness and readiness probes for the Cart service:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc set probe dc/cart --readiness --liveness --get-url=http://:8080/health --initial-delay-seconds=15
----
